## 5. Digital Minimalism

```
Book Title: Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport
Chinese Title: „ÄäÊ∑±Â∫¶Êï∞‰ΩçÂ§ßÊâ´Èô§„Äã by Âç°Â∞î¬∑Á∫ΩÊ≥¢Áâπ (Cal Newport)

I. Digital Minimalism
Digital minimalists do not completely abandon mobile technology or human connections.
They are not anti-technology but rather use technology wisely.
They consider using the fewest number of applications and continuously refine and optimize their use principles.
Consider the following three questions:
1. Does the software you use support what you value?
2. Is it the best way to achieve your values?
3. Do you have a specific plan for how and when to use it?

II. 30-Day Digital Declutter: Digital decluttering is like a system restart. Before you start, you are in a state of accepting all information indiscriminately from the internet.

After it's over, you will become the master of your life, and you will become a digital minimalist who carefully accepts information.

III. Do Not Like
IV. Value Solitude: Disconnect from the internet and create your own thinking space.
V. Reclaim Quality Leisure

When using software,
First, strip away the gimmicks and only use important features (e.g., WeChat for communication, Xiaohongshu for searching, Taobao for shopping without browsing).
Second, break the integration and simplify the functions (return to single functions).
Third, schedule time for low-quality leisure in advance.
Fourth, schedule time and content for quality leisure in advance.
Fifth, use slow media to obtain information; Sixth, directly uninstall addictive software.

This relationship is leading us to the kind of "silent, desperate life that most people lead," as Thoreau wrote in Walden.
But don't forget, Thoreau also wrote: "They think they have no choice, but smart and healthy people know that with the sunrise comes a new day, everything is brand new. It's never too late to abandon prejudices."
